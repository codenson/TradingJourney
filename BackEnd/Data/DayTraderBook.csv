I took my money out at aroud 40percent profit mark(sold 3out of 5 contracts), then I kept 2 runners untill 100 percent profit. The options went higher way beyond where I sold.

",Took a QQQ options trade at .95 cents a pop. The market reversed quickly and I ve been sitting on the red the entire day. The market was so choppy and options didn't see significant price action increases regardless of the ETF climbing slowly. So much chop. ,????????,333,-233.45,1,0,1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Only enter trades when 3/3 conditions are met (market direction, volume confirmation, clear chart setup)."
